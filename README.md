# Spokane Real Estate Sales Analysis

## This is an analysis of data provided by Spokane County to help people determine where to move within Spokane County

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this project is to analyze real estate sales data in Spokane, Washington, focusing on how different zip codes have changed over the years. By understanding these trends, we aim to provide insights into the real estate market dynamics and help make informed decisions.

## Summary of Findings
- **Trends Over Time**: Analysis of sales data reveals trends in property values and sales volume across different zip codes. When dialing in the data to the last three years trends stick out while zoom out to a larger timeframe shows significant impact from general housing market increases between 2017 and 2021.
- **Hotspots**: Certain zip codes have shown remarkable growth, indicating high demand and potential investment opportunities with Spokane Valley covering many of the top zip codes for price growth.
- **Price Fluctuations**: There are notable fluctuations in property prices, influenced by various factors such as economic conditions and local developments. For this reason, I filtered on sales price to remove outlier sales of properties that were likely not in an average home buyers range (Filter out anything over $1M)

## Preview of Analysis
#### 1. Zip codes in the valley have had the greatest increase over recent years with downtown rounding out the top 5

#### 2. If you were interested in "timing the market" you may be able to use information from these graphs to help understand hot and cold times of the year or see a trend down if you monitor it closely with up to date data.

#### 3. As you move down the malloy file, you will notice there are added "where" filters that helped narrow the scope to either avoid bad data (incorrect zip codes) or filter some properties that are likely not for home buyers (over $1M but could be adjusted by user)


## Conclusion
The data revealed here should be able to provide someone withan idea of how the real estate in certain areas of Spokane are trending. With the addition of a few more data points, this data can be further evaluated to be more specific to the buildings of each property and with more calculations, hypothesis can be drawn about the future of some of the zip codes that can help make even more informed decisions. Additionally, some tables could be added to make the data more user friendly i.e. a zip code table would tell users what the name of the zip code is instead of numbers
